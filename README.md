# RestlessRanger
Small endless runner game made for GUC's CSEN 903 course's Mini Project 1

All the assets being used I've made myself, except for the sound effects and the font, which I've gotten from Freesound.org and Google Fonts respectively.

The code is a bit of a mess at the moment, but generally things are handeled by the GameManager script or the Player script, with a few odds and ends managed by small prefab scripts.

Keybinds:

> A/D | Left/Right Arrows : Go left or right

> J/K/L : Activate red, green, and blue forms respectively. Requires 5 energy.

> I : Activate form power. Uses 1 energy.

> Space: Activate ultimate ability (nuke). Consumes 5 energy from all colors.

> 1/2/3: Cheats: Increase red/green/blue energy respectively.

Changes made from requested document:

> Red form's power was changed to jumping

> Nuke was made into the ultimate ability for balancing purposes

> Mute toggle was replaced with a more functional volume slider

> Game speed increases over time, raising the skill floor and ceiling.
